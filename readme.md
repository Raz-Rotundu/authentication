## Authentication Microserice
An authentication service using OAuth2.0 and JWT tokens

## Description
This is a small service I built while I was learning about how to set up OAuth2.0 security with JWT tokens in Spring boot. The service allows one to validate existing users, as well as register new ones. 

For the sake of simplicity, I hardcoded the keys and IDs just to get it working quickly. Anyone wanting to use this will want to do handle the keys in a more secure way such as keeping them in external config files, or other microservices.
